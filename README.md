From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCrXgy8qtjM I learnt the following.

I created a completely blank workspace in Project IDX and then
made it into a Vite project by typing this:

npm init vite .

Then to launch the webpage, I typed:

npm run dev

Then to get started with SVG, I typed this:

npm install @svgdotjs/svg.js

and added a snippet of SVG to main.ts.

Get started by customizing your environment (defined in the .idx/dev.nix file) with the tools and IDE extensions you'll need for your project!
