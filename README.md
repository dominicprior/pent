# Setting up my environment

From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCrXgy8qtjM I learnt the following.

Create a completely blank workspace in Project IDX and then
make it into a Vite project by typing this:

npm init vite .

Then launch the webpage:

npm run dev

Then to get started with SVG, type this:

npm install @svgdotjs/svg.js

and add a snippet of SVG to main.ts.
