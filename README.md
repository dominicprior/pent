# An animated pentominoes tree search

It does the beginning of a simple depth-first search.

(I've added a hacky git branch called less-graphics that counts all the solutions in a couple of minutes).

(This Project IDX workspace has the daft name of 'blank').

(I also somehow added my github as a remote repo and pushed all this.  When cloned onto my local computer, it fails with
'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command).

# Setting up my environment

From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCrXgy8qtjM I learnt the following.

Create a completely blank workspace in Project IDX and then
make it into a Vite project by typing this:

npm init vite .

Then launch the webpage:

npm run dev

Then to get started with SVG, type this:

npm install @svgdotjs/svg.js

and add a snippet of SVG to main.ts.
